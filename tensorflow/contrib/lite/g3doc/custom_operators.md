# How to use custom operators

TensorFlow Lite currently supports a subset of TensorFlow operators. However, it
does support the use of user-provided implementations (as known as custom
implementations) if the model contains an operator that is not supported.

Letâ€™s walk through this via an example. Assume we are using the `Sin` operator
and that we are building a very simple model for a function `y = sin(x +
offset)`, where `offset` is trainable.

The code to train the TensorFlow model will be something like:

```python
offset = tf.get_variable("offset", [1,], tf.float32)
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None,))
y = tf.sin(x + offset)
y_ = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None,))
loss = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(y - y_))
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.001)
train = optimizer.minimize(loss)
```

If you convert this model to Tensorflow Lite format using the TensorFlow Lite
Optimizing Converter with `--allow_custom_ops` argument, and run it with the
default interpreter, the interpreter will raise the following error messages:

```
Didn't find custom op for name 'Sin'
Registration failed.
```

All we need to do to use the op in TensorFlow Lite is define two functions
(`Prepare` and `Eval`), and construct a `TfLiteRegistration`. This code would
look something like this:

```cpp
TfLiteStatus SinPrepare(TfLiteContext* context, TfLiteNode* node) {
  using namespace tflite;
  TF_LITE_ENSURE_EQ(context, NumInputs(node), 1);
  TF_LITE_ENSURE_EQ(context, NumOutputs(node), 1);

  const TfLiteTensor* input = GetInput(context, node, 0);
  TfLiteTensor* output = GetOutput(context, node, 0);

  int num_dims = NumDimensions(input);

  TfLiteIntArray* output_size = TfLiteIntArrayCreate(num_dims);
  for (int i=0; i<num_dims; ++i) {
    output_size->data[i] = input->dims->data[i];
  }

  return context->ResizeTensor(context, output, output_size);
}

TfLiteStatus SinEval(TfLiteContext* context, TfLiteNode* node) {
  using namespace tflite;
  const TfLiteTensor* input = GetInput(context, node,0);
  TfLiteTensor* output = GetOutput(context, node,0);

  float* input_data = input->data.f;
  float* output_data = output->data.f;

  size_t count = 1;
  int num_dims = NumDimensions(input);
  for (int i = 0; i < num_dims; ++i) {
    count *= input->dims->data[i];
  }

  for (size_t i=0; i<count; ++i) {
    output_data[i] = sin(input_data[i]);
  }
  return kTfLiteOk;
}

TfLiteRegistration* Register_SIN() {
  static TfLiteRegistration r = {nullptr, nullptr, SinPrepare, SinEval};
  return &r;
}
```

When initializing the OpResolver, add the custom op into the resolver, this will
register the operator with Tensorflow Lite so that TensorFlow Lite can use the
new implementation.

```cpp
tflite::ops::builtin::BuiltinOpResolver builtins;
builtins.AddCustom("Sin", Register_SIN());
```

Note that a similar process as above can be followed for supporting for a set of
operations instead of a single operator.

## Best Practices for writing custom operators

1.  Optimize memory allocations and de-allocations cautiously. It is more
    efficient to allocate memory in Prepare() instead of Invoke(), and allocate
    memory before a loop instead of in every iteration. Use temporary tensors
    data rather than mallocing yourself (see item 2). Use pointers/references
    instead of copying as much as possible.

2.  If a data structure will persist during the entire operation, we advise
    pre-allocating the memory using temporary tensors. You may need to use
    OpData struct to reference the tensor indices in other functions. See
    example in the
    [kernel for convolution](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/lite/kernels/conv.cc).
    A sample code snippet is below

    ```
    auto* op_data = reinterpret_cast<OpData*>(node->user_data);
    TfLiteIntArrayFree(node->temporaries);
    node->temporaries = TfLiteIntArrayCreate(1);
    node->temporaries->data[0] = op_data->temp_tensor_index;
    TfLiteTensor* temp_tensor = &context->tensors[op_data->temp_tensor_index];
    temp_tensor->type =  kTfLiteFloat32;
    temp_tensor->allocation_type = kTfLiteArenaRw;
    ```

3.  If it doesn't cost too much wasted memory, prefer using a static fixed size
    array (or in Resize() pre-allocated std::vector) rather than using a
    dynamically allocating std::vector every iteration of execution.

4.  Avoid instantiating standard library container templates that don't already
    exist, because they affect binary size. For example, if you need a std::map
    in your operation that doesn't exist in other kernels, using a std::vector
    with direct indexing mapping could work while keeping the binary size small.
    See what other kernels use to gain insight (or ask).

5.  Check the pointer to the memory returned by malloc. If this pointer is
    nullptr, no operations should be performed using that pointer. If you
    malloc() in a function and have an error exit, deallocate memory before you
    exit.

6.  Use TF_LITE_ENSURE(context, condition) to check for a specific condition.
    Your code must not leave memory hanging when TF_LITE_ENSURE is done, i.e.,
    these should be done before any resources are allocated that will leak.
